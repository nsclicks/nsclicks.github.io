              student in addition to working at Starbucks describes her life story in modeling business.
               To aspire to own a business in the same field as she already breeds animals for FEA.
                She is a dedicated and passionate rancher and a model who would like to keep a farm and want to continue to breed.</p>

            <p>Q: For how long you have been doing a modeling?
                I have been actively modeling for 5 years, but I had to stop due to DVT (Deep vein thrombosis) disease.
                 I was invited to go to LA for the company I used to model through, but just a week before the event, I had to undergo a lifesaving surgery; also, I had a kid later.

              <p><strong>Q: Can you talk about the phase when you were suffering by DVT and aftermath?</strong></p>
            <!-- </blockquote> -->
    
            <p>
                It was very hard and disappointing as the Lupus happened at early age, which is not very normal. I could not walk on red carpet.
                 I was already doing runways and modelling and I had to restart from very scratch. It is like making myself back from the ashes like the Phoenix. 
                 There is no medication for it, you don’t know the cause; you just must suffer through Lupus. Mainly women have it especially elderly women. 
                </p>
            
              <p><strong>Did you start your study before the diseases?
                 What were the impacts of having Lupus while studying? </strong></p>

            <p>I started the college long before the diseases. Lupus has effects such as I can’t stand in the sun for too long as I get rashes, you would feel like puking. 
              My face would be red and swollen; it really knocks your confidence down as you don’t really predict how long the diseases is going to last as there is no cure for it. </p>

              <p><strong>Q: Would you prefer Modeling or School?</strong></p>

              <p>I love to model and that for the right reasons. 
                I would want to open my business for extra income or if modeling career doesn’t work out.
                 Both the modeling and owning a business at the same time would be a very nice to have</p>

                  </div>

                <p><strong>Q: What would you like to do to bring awareness through modeling?</strong></p>

                <p>The whole spectrum of the Lupus and blood clot is, they can be serious and it’s insane how many people can be affected by that. 
                  Lupus is mainly internal, so you won’t be able to detect it early enough. 
                  I would hope that my pictures will reach out to many people. If I can do this as a single mom, work full time, go to school, and take care of my animals, I believe anyone can do it. 
</p>
                  <p><strong>Q: Should more people with diseases or disability come out and try modeling?</strong></p>

                  <p>Yes, Definitely. Regardless of your age, you can do so many things and you should always feel comfortable the way you are because it’s what makes you unique. 
                     Get out of your comfort zone, feel good about yourself, do thing that makes you happy, feel beautiful.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Who are your role models?</strong></p>

                    <p>Amberly Snyder. She is a championship Barrel Racer. She got into a car accident and was paralyzed from waist down. She has been a huge inspiration to me.
                       My mom is my biggest role model and the biggest critique. I have seen a lot of deaths in my family, saw my mom going from hospital to hospital which was very hard. My mom is very brave during the tough time and I have huge respect for her. She is very strong and positive person in my life.

                      <p><strong>Q:  Q: Slim is popular in modeling, what are your thought on it and how do you deal with this mentality?</strong></p>

                      <p>In my opinion, just go for it. Make that leap. If you don’t even try, you will never get a chance and will never be able to achieve anything.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>

                        </strong></p>

                        <p>“Keep it respectful”. If you have it, flaunt it. Sadly, whatever you would do, society will judge you no matter what, society needs to change the perspective of Boudoir shoot because she is dressed that way doesn’t define her character.

                          </p>
                      
                          

                      <p><strong><i>Q: Due to judgmental nature of the society not many women prefer to model even the simple photo shoots, they don’t comfortable with their bodies or they’d think that they don’t belong to modeling world. 
                        What is your advice for them?</i></strong></p>
                      <p>I’d say Eat that cake, put the makeup on, be yourself and get that shoot done. Because You Matter and you are beautiful.</p>

                      <p><strong><i>Q: Have you ever dealt with an inappropriate photographer? How do you handle it? Do your followers make inappropriate comments about  your posts on social media? </i></strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, I have experienced it. You should just put them to their place. There are people out there who just want to buy or upload them on some website which is absolutely wrong. 
                          My advice on it is: Be very careful, bring someone you know to a shoot especially if you don’t know a photographer, make sure he/she doesn’t take to a hotel room. Be alert. Talking about my followers on social media, most of the time it is a genuine compliment. I normally take it as compliment and shake it off.
 </p>
 <p><strong><i>Q: Tips or a note of guidance of the struggles you have been through the diseases.</i></strong></p>
 <p>I am more of a realistic person, working very hard through my way out, eat right, have a good lifestyle, reaching out to photographers, making efforts.
    “Everything has to start with you, and your mindset”, It is about you and only you, your personality; not comparing with others just work on yourself. I hope this message reaches out to more people. You can achieve and do anything, but you HAVE to want to do it.

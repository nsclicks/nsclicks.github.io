            <p class="mt-5">While diverse body types are becoming increasingly visible in the fashion 
              industry recently, when asked for a “model body”, generally, very specific image comes to 
              people’s mind – thin waist, long legs, and smooth skin. When looking at beauty advertisement 
              or fashion runways, size zero is still very popular. Since such “model qualities” are rare, 
              models with the “right figure” tend to get paid much more than anyone else in the fashion 
              industry. As soon as people start to see a toned female body or even see a slightest muscle 
              on a female body, they fall into dilemma whether to admire it or be disgusted by it. More 
              than often, it is not being well received.</p>

            <p>Originally a student and a personal trainer, very inspiring Paegan Magner, who has a degree 
              in psychology and finishing up her Bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science talks about the 
              struggles in the modeling business as being a fitness model and trainer. Paegan wants to 
              pursue her master’s degree in psychology, specifically sports psychology. She has started 
              her online business for health and fitness where she provides online training. I have got a 
              chance to work with her on multiple occasions and this time, I got a chance to take her 
              interview. </p>

            <!-- </blockquote> -->
    
            <p>I would like to open my own women only studio for health and awareness to support 
              women and helping them grow. The main reason for women only studio is; honestly, it is 
              intimidating to exercise with men. I would encourage an environment where women are not 
              judged and they would feel comfortable and be themselves.</p>
            
              <p><strong>Would you prefer modeling or gym?</strong></p>

            <p>In my opinion, they both go hand in hand. Modeling gives me power and confidence to put 
              myself out there, see your beauty.</p>

              <p><strong>Around the world, models should allegedly be skinny and very slim, in order 
                to do that, they have eating disorders and still have to be in shape. Why is that, 
                what are your thoughts on this mentality?</strong></p>

              <p>Generally speaking it is not acceptable for women to be fat, we are still stuck in 
                80s and 90s where models used to be very skinny and they had to maintain slim physique. 
                It is gradually changing now. <strong>Fit is new sexy and strong is new skinny.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>What is the motivation that keeps you going every day?</strong></p>

                <p>It took me years to realize my own strength and powers, but when I started doing the 
                  fitness training, it was really amazing that I would like to hold on to. To realize my 
                  strength and realization that I can do it empowers me to keep doing it. Moreover, I 
                  work with clients every day and it really encourages me.</p>

                  <p><strong>How do you advertise yourself?</strong></p>

                <p>I have my own website for my business where I can advertise myself. The biggest place 
                  to put the word out is Instagram, I have my own Instagram account where I connect the 
                  most with people where I post my modeling and fitness related updates.</p>

                <p><strong>Who are your role models?</strong></p>

                <p>There are so many incredibly strong role models  in my life - some very real 
                  people and some very impactful  heroines. If I had to nail down a few I would 
                  definitely say Casey Samsel (IG: @caseysamsel_bikini) is a huge role model in my 
                  fitness/bodybuilding life. She is an IFBB Bikini Pro and 3 times Olympian. She is 
                  incredibly driven to her goals and works hard to educate herself and her followers 
                  everyday on the ins-and-outs of female bodybuilding.</p>
                <p>On a personal level, I have some great and amazing women in my life that I look up 
                  to every day - a very close friend named Sam (IG: @itsasamthing) is someone I strive to 
                  be more like with each passing day - she is so dedicated to living her best life, setting 
                  and reaching goals, and being secure in her faith and love of God.  My husband is also a 
                  huge source of inspiration and drive for me - he pushes me to be better and to grow in 
                  every avenue of my life and is the most supporting and loving partner I could have asked 
                  for.</p>
                <p>Finally - on a fictional note - Claire Fraser (IG: @outlander_starz) of the 
                  Outlander novels is an all around bad ass woman who I have looked up to for so 
                  many years and many more to come. I can’t leave out my love for her and Diana 
                  Gabaldon (Website: dianagabaldon.com) created by her.</p>

                  <p><strong>What are the obstacles in day-to-day modeling and fitness life?</strong></p>

                  <p>Being female in sport world, which is mainly driven by men, is tough. I coach athletes, I 
                    coach everyday people; barrier is that you have to prove yourself a little bit harder in the 
                    industry. However, once you are in there you get the respect you deserve. There is obviously 
                    some types of separation like some things are only for men and some are only for female, which 
                    can be one of the biggest barriers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Have you faced any inappropriate behavior while shooting, at gym or on social media? How do 
                      you tackle that?</strong></p>

                    <p>I haven’t had any bad experience with photographer I shoot with for modeling. They are extremely 
                      professional; I have had great shoots and have good relationship with them. While in body building 
                      world, both male and female do not find it appropriate to have women a muscle, it is not attractive 
                      to have masculine body for women; I would get more heat and negativity from women. I used to not to 
                      react to all the negativity.</p>

                      <p><strong>What are your thoughts on bullying and body shaming?</strong></p>

                      <p>I was a cheerleader in high school and we were taught just to smile and nod and not to react 
                        to those comments. I am confidant of my body and how I dress up in my personal life; however, 
                        back in the days, I used to get the heat from both men and women if I would wear revealing cloths 
                        and because of that, I changed my dressing style then. However, in last few years, I have decided 
                        that it is my life and body; if I feel like I’m not doing anything inappropriate, then I don’t 
                        have to worry about the negativity. I would show up with confidence.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why do not many people do fitness shoot or not many fit people do modeling? How to encourage them?</strong></p>

                        <p>There are obviously two different worlds here. There are few handful of fitness photographers 
                          in one world who don’t do the everyday photography and there are many fashion or editorial 
                          who don’t do fitness shoots. Both types of photographers are many afraid to come out of their 
                          worlds and go in each other’s worlds. I would personally like to do an editorial shoot right 
                          after the fitness show when I’m super leaned and fit, which you don’t see many. Fitness models 
                          tend to shoot more in the gym working out or being active, but I would like to see more of the 
                          fashion or editorial photographers to be open to shoot fit women in editorial or fashion shoots.</p>

                      <p><strong><i>My take:</i></strong></p>
                      <p>While talking to Paegan, I got some very good content and some insights in the fitness model’s world. 
                        Fit women might not feel welcomed in the fashion world, however, it is changing gradually. 
                        As being one of the fashion and editorial photographers, I think everyone should make them feel 
                        more welcomed and encourage them by casting fit women for shoots. Obviously every photographer 
                        has a theme in mind and they have somewhat idea of what type of model they want to cast for their 
                        shoot, it is necessary not to get stuck in “zero figure” mindset. All types of body should be 
                        welcomed in fashion world. On the other hand, it is also important that fit women feel confident 
                        about their bodies and try to do more fashion shoots or at least advertise that they are open to 
                        work on any style of shoots.</p>

                        <p>As far as the bullying goes, instead of keeping quiet, smile and nod the head, people should 
                          stand up for themselves and teach bullies a lesson. If people are seeing someone getting bullied, 
                          they should rather raise their voice instead of joining the bullies or ignoring them. Everyone 
                          should be treated with respect and equality.</p>

                        <p>On that note, this is my first interview of many more to come. Please let me 
                          know your thoughts as well as share similar stories you may have. Any feedback 
                          is also always welcomed. <i><strong>This is Nick signing off…</strong></i></p>

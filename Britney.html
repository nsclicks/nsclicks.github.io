            <p class="mt-5">In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Department of Education released 
              the first federal uniform definition of bullying for research and surveillance. The core 
              elements of the definition include unwanted aggressive behavior; observed or perceived power 
              imbalance; and repetition of behaviors or high likelihood of repetition. As some awareness is 
              being spread, we still hear some heartbreaking stories occasionally. It’s a known fact that 
              bullying has a big impact on one’s life. Similar impact can also be left by rejection. If you 
              know you are right for the job, but when you get rejected and you must go through the whole cycle 
              again and again in a hope of a breakthrough, that just doesn’t sit right with some people. 
              Many people get discouraged and take some serious steps which can hurt themselves and the ones 
              they love. However, there are also some people who usually sees positive from all of it, try to 
              improve themselves, work hard at it, and finally achieve something big. I present to 
              you someone who’s been through bullying and rejection, and yet working hard everyday and inspiring 
              many along the way: <b>Britney Speckert.</b></p>

              <p><strong>Why did you choose to pursue a career as model?</strong></p>
            <!-- </blockquote> -->
    
            <p>I have been an actor since my childhood. I started in ballet and got to be a part of a 
              couple of plays. Since then, I’ve enrolled in many acting classes. When I was 13, I went 
              to LA with my dad to participate in an event where I was chosen as one of the Top 10 Monologue
              from my state. After that, I got signed by an agency called MGMT Artists. During that time, size 4, 
              which considered as a plus-size, had no place in modeling industry, and due to that, I was considered 
              overweight and doing modeling wasn’t my exact focus. Fast-forwarding 4 years, I moved to LA to start 
              my college. I decided to give modeling a try, started building my portfolio, and eventually got signed 
              with a smaller agency called Numa Models. I noticed how much the modeling industry has changed, hence I 
              decided to be a model who advocates for women who have dealt with issues such as bullying and overweight 
              like mine. There are plenty of reasons to get discouraged and not to pursue this career, especially 
              since it’s not fair and easy-to-get-into industry, but it’s a small price to pay if you think you’re 
              on the right path to advocate for and inspire people around the world.</p>
            
              <p><strong>What’s your biggest strength and weakness?</strong></p>

            <p>In modeling field, my biggest strength, I’d say, is to be able to take rejections and putting everything I’ve got when it comes to 
              auditions and shoots. The biggest weakness would be my impatient nature when it comes to certain things. </p>

              <p><strong>Tell me about your education and classes or courses you have done for modeling.</strong></p>

              <p>I am going to Santa Monica College and will graduate in Fall 2020 with the degree in Social Science 
                and Humanities. After that, I’m planning to major in Women Studies. Unfortunately, I haven’t found 
                any courses related to modeling, but for acting, I have done theater. I have taken a few courses on 
                Women Studies and Nutrition which sits well with my envision of living a healthy life, educating others, 
                and support women.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>What is your ultimate goal and what are you doing to achieve it?</strong></p>

                <p>Overall, I just to be a complete happy and content with my life. Career wise, it would be 
                  nice be to be able to make living off of modeling work with brands that support what I love. I 
                  also work as a babysitter for certain families because I love helping kids and making them feel 
                  good about themselves. I want to do something related to fitness, i.e. personal trainer.</p>

                  <p><strong>How do you usually communicate with agencies, photographers, fellow models, or fans of your work?</strong></p>

                <p>Mostly through social media. I was fortunate to be able to have a video interview talking about my 
                  background with a great body positive page. I’m a huge fitness freak. /I usually run into people 
                  at the gym or hikes and we talk about what am I doing for my fitness. Everytime I go in for 
                  casting or reach out to brands that support my message, I send them about story of my platform 
                  and send them links of those. Over time, I have received a great amount of response. I use my 
                  Instagram to share highlights of my meal prep and workout. I usually respond to all of the 
                  messages to the best of my ability. </p>
                
                  <p><strong>How do you advertise yourself?</strong></p>

                <p>I have been to some casting calls through my agency over the years, but I have also 
                  started doing to freelancing work which has taken me a lot further in my career than 
                  I expected. Usually photographers reach out to me for shoots, but I also look for 
                  photographers whose work I like and fits well within my expertise and style and message 
                  them. I also get some calls through my casting website, but to be honest, I have also 
                  waited in long, around the block lines, to get casted. Doing model interviews, such as this 
                  one, also helps me getting acknowledge by others.  </p>

                <p><strong>What does your diet look like?</strong></p>

                <p>I try to stay away from dairy and red meat. I lean on turkey and chicken mostly. 
                  I eat fish, fruits, veggies and do protein shakes. You would be amazed by how good 
                  some vegan cheeses are and it’s a well-known fact that oats and almond milk are very 
                  healthy. Occasionally, I do have cheat days when I eat lots of candies and some other 
                  “bad stuff”, but it’s truly all about moderation. </p>

                  <p><strong>Any obstacles do you face while pursuing modeling or trying to achieve your goals?</strong></p>

                  <p>I think everyone in the entertainment industry faces obstacles, as I have said earlier, 
                    it’s not an easy field. For most of the people, it’s getting rejected is one of the top 
                    obstacles, which is also true in my case, but along with that, specifically I come across 
                    this issue is not being able to fit into clothes when I go try them because my top fits 
                    size 2, but my hips are easily 4-8 category depending on the stretch. Workout wise, I’d 
                    say my laziness and m comfortable bed.</p>

                    <p><strong>What’s the hardship in this business? </strong></p>

                    <p>It’s not as easy as it seems from outside. Anyone can take pictures (ouch), but 
                      modeling for something or someone making a living out of it can be difficult. Everyone 
                      wants to be “the one”. It’s heartbreaking when you wait in long lines in LA, just to get 
                      rejected, and the next day, you have to start over the same routine again. I believe every 
                      body type women or men should be included as a look in the industry, but the hardship about 
                      modeling is, even when we reach that area fully, still not everyone will make it. If everyone 
                      could get in easily, it would be no different than an everyday job, so if you want to make 
                      into the entertainment industry, you have to give your best.</p>

                      <p><strong>What is your background and struggle story?</strong></p>

                      <p>I grew up overweight and in a family full of men. I was bullied a lot growing up because 
                        I was tall and big. Acting was my biggest thing, but I never thought I could model. I did 
                        participate in sports throughout my high school, which is when I started losing weight. Now 
                        that I was losing weight, people had problems with it and started saying I starved myself just 
                        because I kept my curvy body. It didn’t affect me much, but I always thought about those kids 
                        who bullies and how messed up it is to even think such things because someone loses healthy weight. 
                        I also had many girls try to tear me down over the years due to their own insecurities.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How is your experience with criticism and how do you handle it?</strong></p>

                        <p>I have TONS of experience with criticism. Growing up, I did ballet and being a bigger 
                          girl in ballet, teachers are extra hard on you. I also got some hardship from my brothers 
                          while growing up. In high school, we had counselors who would test you to see what kind of 
                          job you will have in future. My answer always stayed the same – modeling and acting, but she 
                          always discouraged me saying it’s really hard to make it and the odds are, I wouldn’t make it 
                          and always asked me to take the test again. Other girls, who usually have their own 
                          insecurities, always tried to kick me down instead of lifting me up when I needed the most.</p>
                        
                          <p><strong>Do you have tips for people who face similar issues as you do or have same goals as you do?</strong></p>
                          <p>
                            Easier said than done, but love yourself. Life is hard, so try best and do what you want 
                            to do for you and also what makes you happy. If you have goals, manifest. The amount of 
                            amazing things that come to me from manifestation amazes me. I’m also here to answer 
                            questions related to fitness, dieting, or modeling, so reach out as needed.

                      <p><strong><i>My take:</i></strong></p>
                      <p>While talking to Britney, I got some very good content and some insights. Bullying and rejections 
                        can give you anger, but use that anger in something positive. use that anger to prove your worth.
                        Use that anger to motoivate yourself. Use that anger to improve yourself. There is always going to 
                        be ups and downs, but you will overcome it and acheive something one day. Success doesn't come in 
                        one day, and specially not in entertainment industry. From outside, it looks glamorous, but the 
                        reality is just the opposite. All in all, make a goal, work hard towards it and the success will
                        be at your feet one day. 
                        </p>
